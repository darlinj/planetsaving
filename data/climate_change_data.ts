Air freighted delicate foods like soft fruit from South America are the worst offenders which emit 50-100 times the CO2 than food transported by sea but this account for 2.5% of your carbon print on average. For beef the feed transport is only 0.5% of the carbon that is released so you are better off choosing lower carbon plant based food options with high food miles than buying local beef, lamb or cheese.  Having said that 83% of the emissions from food transport come from road transport largely in the UK so local food is still better but it has less of an impact than you may think.  So to summarize.  Local food is good. Air freighted food is very bad so avoid berries and tender veg from a long way away.
